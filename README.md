@scii (pronounced "AT-SCII") is a modified version
 of the AsciiEffect from the [three.js examples](https://unpkg.com/browse/three@0.160.0/examples/jsm/effects/AsciiEffect.js). It aims to deliver a higher performance when using colors compared to the old effect and also supports colors based on the brightness of pixels, letting you create gradients based on the amount of light hitting a certain object.

## Trying out the effect
If you want to have a look at how this works, download the code and run Vite locally. Optionally, an interactable demo can be found [on my portfolio website](https://codedotspirit.dev/portfolio/ascii-effect).

## Can I use this?
Yes. This is just my own take on a [script from 2012 by @blurspline](https://unpkg.com/browse/three@0.160.0/examples/jsm/effects/AsciiEffect.js), who themselves based the ASCII generation on [a script by @hassadee](https://github.com/hassadee/jsascii/blob/master/jsascii.js) from 2008. Both of these scripts were MIT licensed, and so I chose to use the same license.
