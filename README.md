# PerformantAsciiEffect
A modified version of the AsciiEffect from the [three.js examples](https://unpkg.com/browse/three@0.160.0/examples/jsm/effects/AsciiEffect.js). This version is way more performant when using colors and also supports colors based on the brightness of pixels.

## Trying out the code
If you wanna have a look at how this works, download the code and run Vite locally.

## Can I use this?
Yes. This is just my own take on a [script from 2012 by @blurspline](https://unpkg.com/browse/three@0.160.0/examples/jsm/effects/AsciiEffect.js), who themselves based the ASCII generation on [a script by @hassadee](https://github.com/hassadee/jsascii/blob/master/jsascii.js) from 2008. Both of these scripts were MIT licensed, and so I chose to use the same license.
